# CrudProject
I designed a brand new website for shopping list using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. In this project, JavaScript operations attract attention. You can add a new element, delete or update it. As you refresh the page, you can view the information that you added, deleted or updated, as it is stored in localstorage.

# The following technologies were used in the frontend development phase of my site:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

# Features
- LocalStorage Operations: Add, Update, Delete
- You can add, delete or update elements to the page instantly.
